# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version
#   is generally handled by the user. In contrast, for a dedicated application, it may
#   be useful to check them into the repository (e.g., when version is pinned).

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if contributors use different OSes or Python versions,
#   it may cause issues.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
